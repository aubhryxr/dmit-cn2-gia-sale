## What's the Deal with DMIT's Free Server Compensation?

To make up for network disruptions, DMIT is automatically issuing free plans to existing customers:

**For HKG Pro/HKG EB and TYO Pro/TYO EB users:** You'll receive a Los Angeles LAX.Pro.Echo package (originally $45.9/year). The duration matches your existing server's expiration date, up to one full year.

**For HKG T1/TYO T1 users:** You'll get a Los Angeles LAX T1 package for up to three months.

All compensation packages will be automatically credited to your account by November 15, 2025—no ticket submission required. Pretty straightforward, right?

## Why DMIT's CN2 GIA Network Stands Out

Here's the thing about CN2 GIA: it's China Telecom's premium international backbone network. What does that actually mean for you? Lower latency, rock-solid stability, and virtually zero packet loss. If you're running cross-border services or need reliable enterprise deployment, this is the kind of infrastructure that just works.

The PRO series packages come with 1Gbps bandwidth, native IPv4 addresses, and a /64 IPv6 block thrown in. Whether you're hosting websites, setting up acceleration services, or deploying enterprise applications, these specs deliver consistent performance.

## Japan TYO Pro Series Breakdown

The Tokyo PRO lineup runs on CN2 GIA routes with native IPv4 and impressive specs:

**TYO.Pro.TINY** starts with 2GB RAM, 40GB NVMe storage, 1TB monthly traffic on 1Gbps bandwidth. **TYO.Pro.STARTER** bumps things up to 4GB RAM and 80GB storage with 2TB transfer. **TYO.Pro.MEDIUM** offers 8GB RAM, 160GB storage, and 4TB traffic.

For heftier workloads, **TYO.Pro.LARGE** includes 16GB RAM and 320GB storage with 6TB monthly transfer, while **TYO.Pro.GIANT** maxes out at 32GB RAM, 640GB storage, and 8TB traffic.

All packages support custom ISO uploads, snapshot backups, and come with DMIT's trademark network stability.

## Hong Kong HKG Pro Series Options

The Hong Kong PRO series mirrors the Tokyo setup with CN2 GIA connectivity and native IPv4:

**HKG.Pro.TINY** through **HKG.Pro.GIANT** follow the same RAM/storage progression as Tokyo plans. The key difference? Geographic location. Hong Kong typically offers slightly lower latency to mainland China and Southeast Asian users.

Each plan includes the same 1Gbps bandwidth, NVMe storage, and premium network routing that makes DMIT's infrastructure worth considering.

## Japan and Hong Kong T1 Series

The T1 series serves as DMIT's entry-level option with BGP optimized networks—still solid performance, just without the premium CN2 GIA routing. These work perfectly fine for testing environments, personal projects, or applications where you don't need absolute top-tier connectivity.

T1 packages start smaller and cost less, making them accessible for users who want DMIT's infrastructure without the PRO price tag. You'll find options ranging from 1GB to 8GB RAM with proportional storage and bandwidth allocations.

## Payment Methods and Data Center Locations

DMIT operates self-built data centers across the United States, Japan, and Hong Kong. Their network infrastructure primarily leverages CN2 GIA and BGP optimized routing, with package options covering standard, DDoS-protected, and unlimited traffic variants.

Payment flexibility is actually pretty impressive: PayPal, Alipay, WeChat Pay, and major credit cards are all accepted. No jumping through hoops to get service started.

## Common Questions About This Promotion

**Q: What makes CN2 GIA worth the premium pricing?**  
A: CN2 GIA is China Telecom's premium international backbone offering significantly lower latency, higher stability, and minimal packet loss compared to standard routes. For cross-border access and enterprise deployments, the performance difference is immediately noticeable.

**Q: Do I need to submit a ticket for the free server compensation?**  
A: Nope. The system automatically credits eligible accounts by November 15, 2025. Just sit back and wait for the notification.

**Q: Are the promotional discounts one-time or recurring?**  
A: These promo codes offer recurring discounts, meaning you'll enjoy the same savings on renewals. That's actually pretty rare and makes the value proposition much stronger long-term.

**Q: Can I upgrade from T1 to PRO series later?**  
A: Generally yes, though you'll want to contact DMIT support for migration specifics. Most providers allow plan upgrades with proper notice.
